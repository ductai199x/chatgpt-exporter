## 🔧 What's Different in This Fork

- **DOM scraping for generated images** — Upstream fetches `sediment://` images via the OpenAI file download API. This fork scrapes the high-res rendered image directly from the page DOM, targeting the sharp/full-quality version inside `div.relative.z-1` containers.
- **JPEG compression** — Scraped images are re-encoded as JPEG at 0.95 quality to reduce exported file size.
- **Dual asset pointer support** — Handles both legacy `file-service://` (via API) and current `sediment://` (via DOM scraping) image pointers.
- **Image fetch error fallback** — `getBase64FromImageUrl` has a try/catch with a fetch+blob fallback when canvas conversion fails.
- **Standardized CI/CD** — Build artifacts are not committed to the repo. Releases are created manually and the built userscript is uploaded as a GitHub Release asset.

## 💡 Example

### Text

```
You:
I'm creating a ChatGPT Exporter. What do you think?

ChatGPT:
It sounds like you're planning on creating a tool that uses the ChatGPT model
to export text. ChatGPT is a large language model trained by OpenAI that is
designed to generate human-like text responses based on a given input. It can
be used for a variety of applications, such as chatbots, automated responses
to customer inquiries, and more.

However, please keep in mind that as a large language model, ChatGPT has not
been specifically trained for any specific task, so the quality of the
generated text will depend on how it is used and the context in which it is
applied. It's important to use ChatGPT responsibly and consider the potential
consequences of using it in any given situation.
